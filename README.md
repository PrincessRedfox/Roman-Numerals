# Roman-Numerals
TASK
Roman numerals continue to be used for certain limited purposes, such as copyright dates.  The symbols used are; 
I – 1
V – 5
X – 10
L – 50
C – 100
D – 500
M – 1000

One definition of Roman numerals is:

•	The letters must be in descending order of value.
•	The value of the number is the sum of all the letters.
•	A letter must not be repeated if it can be replaced by another letter.

This is known as the additive rule and is the only rule to be used in this assessment.  Note that Roman numerals are always whole numbers and cannot have fractional values.
For example:

•	MCX = 1000 + 100 +10 = 1110
•	MXC is invalid because of the wrong order.
•	IIII = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
•	IIIII is invalid because it can be replaced with V

A manufacturing company wishes to make a new calculator that allows the user to input two numbers in Arabic decimal form (each input number must not exceed 2499) and displays the numbers in Roman numeral form.  The calculator then allows a user to add or subtract the two numbers, displaying the result in both Arabic decimal and Roman numeral form.
